      <description>Many questions test the concept of conditional probability via Bayesâ€™ Rule. The results may be counter-intuitive, which can normally be attributed to base rate fallacy.
This post summarizes some commonly used techniques to solve such problems. Then, we will illustrate the method using a few well-known textbook examples. After reading this post, one should be able to easily tackle a widely covered class of questions.</description>
